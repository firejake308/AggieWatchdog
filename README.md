# Aggie Watchdog
Aggie Watchdog is a mobile app that notifies students at Texas A&M University when seats open up
in a class that they want. It's built in React Native, and available on Expo and coming soon to
the Google Play Store.

## Contributing
I'm a student just like y'all, and I only have so much free time. If you have a feature idea that
you'd like to see in the app, just fork this repo, implement it, and submit a Pull Request, and
I'll try to incorporate it into the production build.

## Bug Reports
Submitting bug reports as issues on GitHub is preferred, but sending an email to 
[me](mailto:insertcoolnamehereinc@gmail.com) is also fine. I've only really been able to test this
app on my Android, so any feedback is welcome, especially if you're runnin on iOS.
